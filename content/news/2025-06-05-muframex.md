I had the pleasure of participating in the 2025 ["Semaine Franco-Mexicaine de l’Intelligence Artificielle : de la théorie aux applications."](https://www.muframex.fr/ecole-dete-en-ia-2025-muframex-ipn/) This week-long event, organized by the Franco-Mexican organization MUFRAMEX, took place at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional in Mexico City. I was invited to give a seminar on [AI and Renewable Energy](https://www.ipn.mx/investigacion/eventos/polinterpares/inicio.html) and to help run a hackathon on city bike share programs. It was great to meet the motivated students of Mexico City and to discuss sustainability and AI with them.

The video of my seminar is available [online](https://www.youtube.com/live/yXC5H62cLUI?feature=shared&t=68):
