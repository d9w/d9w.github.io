I am pleased to announce that I have been given the title of "Professeur [ISAE-Supaero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/)". This follows the passing of my [HDR](https://d9w.github.io/news/2025/04/07/habilitation-%C3%A0-diriger-des-recherches-defense/) earlier this year. Tenure systems are different everywhere and translating between them is difficult. In most public universities in France, the title of "Professeur" is a state-mandated one with a cap on the number of positions, meaning it can take years to wait for a fitting one to open up. In the American system, full tenure is a fully university-level decision, something that I've heard can be very contentious. I feel like I got the best of both worlds; the HDR is a formal process recognized by the state and was a qualification for becoming Professeur ISAE-Supaero, and the rest of the decision was an internal one made by the school. I'm grateful for the support of ISAE-Supaero and my colleagues who encouraged me along this path. Now that I've climbed this ladder, I'm looking around and wondering, "what's next?"
