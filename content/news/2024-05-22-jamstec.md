This summer, I have the chance to be working at the [Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC)](https://www.jamstec.go.jp/), a world-renowned research institute that conducts research in marine science, oceanography, and earth science. I'm working in the [Application Laboratory](https://www.jamstec.go.jp/al/), where I'm researching the application of AI to modeling ocean dynamics and climate change.

Specifically, I'll be working on the [SINTEX](https://www.jamstec.go.jp/virtualearth/expert/en/index.html) model, which is an [ensemble model](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/32/3/jcli-d-18-0193.1.xml) of 108 different climate, ocean, and ice models. The SINTEX model is one of the models used by the [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf) to predict the future climate of the Earth, so I'm very excited to work on it. My research will focus on improving the accuracy of these ensemble predictions using interpretable machine learning techniques.

I've been familiar with JAMSTEC for many years, with my first experience being with the [Deep-sea Debris Database](https://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/dsdebris/e/index.html). This large, publicly available dataset has annotated images of marine life and human debris on the sea floor at impressive depths of thousands of kilometers, collected by specialized underwater research vessels. I've used this dataset in my own research on ocean plastic pollution, so it was very exciting for me to see the ROVs that collected this data in person.

My three-month visit to JAMSTEC was made possible through grants from [ISAE-Supaero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/) and the [Fondation ISAE-SUPAERO](https://fondation-isae-supaero.org/). I'm very grateful for their support which has allowed me to work on such an exciting project. I'm looking forward to sharing more about my research in the coming months.
