I had the pleasure of organizing a small [workshop in Toulouse](https://d9w.github.io/TEML/) on the theme of Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning. Participants from Paul Templier's thesis defense and other invited members came to Toulouse from the UK, Italy, and other parts of France for the workshop. We had talks on robotics, interpretable ML, fitness landscape analysis, and large language models. It was an exciting day, complete with lots of French food and wine.
