The 2024 GECCO, held in Melbourne, was a busy conference for my team and collaborations. 
I was a part of the organization of the [Graph-based Genetic Programming Workshop](https://graphgp.com/) and the [Interpretable Control Competition](https://giorgia-nadizar.github.io/interpretable-control-competition/).
We presented a summary of Paul-Antoine le Tolguenec's TELO article ["Curiosity Creates Diversity in Policy Search"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3605782) in the Hot off the Press track. 
Giorgia Nadizar presented our work on ["Searching for a Diversity of Interpretable Graph Control Policies"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3638529.3653987).
We won the Best Paper award in the CS track for Paul Templier's article ["Quality with Just Enough Diversity in Evolutionary Policy Search"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04308).
And I was very honored to present the work of KÃ©vin Cortacero and colleagues on ["Evolutionary design of explainable algorithms for biomedical image segmentation"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42664-x) at the 2024 [Humies competition](https://www.human-competitive.org/). We won the first place Gold Award, which was a great honor.
It was also a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with some colleagues and to meet new ones, especially from Asian and Australian universities.
