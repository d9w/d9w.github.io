<!-- Research Focus -->
## Research Focus

My work spans evolutionary algorithms, machine learning, and the application of AI to climate science. I pursue three main research theses: genetic programming offers an interpretable and competitive alternative to deep learning; exploration in search and learning can improve AI robustness; and machine learning can help us understand climate change.

### Graph-based Genetic Programming

My research demonstrates that Graph-based Genetic Programming (GraphGP) can generate interpretable models competitive with state-of-the-art deep learning. Key publications include:

- **Evolving Simple Programs for Playing Atari Games** (GECCO 2018): Demonstrated GraphGP's competitiveness with deep reinforcement learning on the Atari benchmark, laying the foundation for interpretable genetic programming
- **Naturally Interpretable Control Policies** (EuroGP 2024, Best Paper Award): Showed GraphGP creates interpretable control policies rivaling deep reinforcement learning for standard robotic tasks
- **Evolutionary Design of Explainable Algorithms for Biomedical Image Segmentation** (Nature Communications 2023, Humies Gold Award): Presented a GraphGP method for optimizing interpretable analysis pipelines, achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art neural networks
- **Evolution of Inherently Interpretable Visual Control Policies** (GECCO 2025, Best Paper Award): Demonstrated that interpretable policies can solve visual control tasks at performance similar to deep reinforcement learning while remaining fully transparent

### Exploration in Search and Learning

My work advances exploration techniques in both evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning:

- **Quality with Just Enough Diversity in Evolutionary Policy Search** (GECCO 2024, Best Paper Award): Introduced a novel evolutionary policy search algorithm balancing exploration and exploitation for more robust and diverse policy generation
- **Exploration-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Avionic System Fault Detection** (ISSTA 2024, SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award): Demonstrated that evolutionary exploration algorithms can detect faults in critical avionic systems not found by standard verification methods
- **Exploration by Learning Diverse Skills through Successor State Measures** (NeurIPS 2024): Presented LEADS, an exploration algorithm leveraging successor state measures to learn diverse skills and enhance exploration in multi-task environments

### Machine Learning for Climate Science

I apply machine learning to accelerate environmental science in the face of climate change:

- **Satellite Derived Bathymetry Using Deep Learning** (Machine Learning 2021): Introduced a deep learning model for estimating bathymetry from satellite data, improving coastal geography analysis
- **Improving a Shoreline Forecasting Model with Symbolic Regression** (ICLR CCAI Workshop 2023): Used genetic programming to improve existing shoreline models, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy
- **Predicting beach profiles with machine learning from offshore wave reflection spectra** (Environmental Modelling & Software 2025): Detailed a machine learning approach to forecasting beach profiles using wave reflection data

## Personal

My main hobbies are reading, hiking, cooking, and games of all sorts. I am currently developing a tabletop role-playing game and enjoy challenging video games. I am a level 2 scuba diver in the French system and would love to dive with whales someday. I speak English natively, French fluently (C1), Hebrew conversationally, a fair bit of Spanish, and am starting to learn Japanese.
