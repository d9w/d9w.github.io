title: About
author: Dennis G. Wilson
---

I am a researcher and educator in artificial intelligence and data science. I am an ["enseignant-chercheur (HDR)"](https://personnel.isae-supaero.fr/dennis-wilson) (Associate Professor equivalent) at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/). My research is inspired by the many forms of biological intelligence, specifically through the study of evolutionary algorithms and neural networks. My doctoral studies at the [Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT)](https://www.irit.fr/) focused on the evolution of design principles for artificial neural networks. Prior to that, I developed my passion for evolutionary strategies and development models in the [Anyscale Learning For All group](https://alfagroup.csail.mit.edu/) at [CSAIL, MIT](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), working on [optimizing wind farm layouts](https://www.irit.fr/wind-competition/). I am interested in environmental applications of AI, which currently drives my research on using AI to [help accelerate environmental science](https://hal.science/hal-04281530/document) in the face of climate change.

My complete CV follows. It is also available as a [PDF](https://d9w.github.io/wilson_cv.pdf).
